# Docker Image Deployment with Jenkins Pipeline

This repository provides a solution for automatically deploying Docker images using a Jenkins pipeline. The primary goal is to streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency across different environments.

## Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy Docker images seamlessly through Jenkins pipelines.
- **Environment Support**: Easily configure deployments for multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Integration**: Integrates with Jenkins, Docker, and other relevant tools for a smooth deployment workflow.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Jenkins pipeline for deploying Docker images, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jenkins**: Install and configure Jenkins on your server or local machine.

2. **Install Plugins**: Install the necessary Jenkins plugins for Docker integration and pipeline support.

3. **Configure Credentials**: Set up credentials in Jenkins for accessing Docker registries or other required services.

4. **Create Pipeline Job**: Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins and configure it to fetch the pipeline script from your repository.

5. **Define Pipeline Script**: Define the pipeline script in your repository's Jenkinsfile, specifying the stages for building and deploying Docker images.

6. **Trigger Deployment**: Trigger the deployment process manually or automatically based on your preferred criteria.

For detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips, refer to the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md).

## Usage

To deploy a Docker image using the Jenkins pipeline:

1. Push changes to the designated branch in your version control system (e.g., Git).
2. Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline, initiating the deployment process.
3. Monitor the pipeline's progress in the Jenkins dashboard and review any logs or notifications for updates.


## Customization

Customize the deployment process to fit your specific requirements by modifying:

- Environment variables
- Dockerfile configurations
- Deployment strategies

Refer to the [Customization Guide]([docs/customization.md](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)) for detailed instructions on adapting the pipeline to your needs.
